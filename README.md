### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

Ejecting exposes the configuration files and scripts, allowing you full control over them.
Use this with caution, as it's irreversible and might require manual configuration.

## Running Tests

Explain how to launch the test runner and provide any additional information about testing.

## Deployment

Provide information about deploying your app, whether it's to a server or a hosting service.
