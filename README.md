Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes.
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

Ejecting exposes the configuration files and scripts, allowing you full control over them.
Use this with caution, as it's irreversible and might require manual configuration.
